# interview_project_alex_peter
I've included some screenshots of what the app looks like in `/screenshots*` so you can see the app on a large screen.  
Project was done in `React` with `webpack` + `Babel`. I opted not to use `flux` or `Redux` because for a small project without much state manipulation, those frameworks just slow the development process down. 


## Installation

Download source code or run  
`git init`  
`git pull https://github.com/nikodevv/interview_project_alex_peter`

Then (I'm using npm 5.6.0):  
`npm install`

## Run App
`npm start`  
You can also build by:
`npm build`
